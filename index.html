      <h2>Story</h2>
      <p>
        Jack, a skilled operative working for <strong>NovaCore Industries</strong>, was assigned a mission unlike any other. The company had recently discovered a mysterious stone buried deep within a forgotten village â€” a stone capable of powering a weapon for over 100 years. But this wasnâ€™t just any relic. It was fiercely guarded by the villageâ€™s former inhabitants, now transformed into relentless zombies after exposure to a deadly, orb-shaped bacteria that corrupted their minds and bodies.
      </p>
      <p>
        Determined to retrieve the stone, Jack ventured into the heart of the infected zone. Armed with grit and precision, he fought through waves of the undead, navigating crumbling ruins and eerie silence. Each encounter tested his resolve, but Jack pressed on â€” not just for the mission, but for something far more personal.
      </p>
      <p>
        After a brutal final standoff, Jack secured the stone and escaped the village, barely surviving the horrors within. The reward for completing the mission was substantial, and Jack used it to admit his ailing mother into one of the countryâ€™s most renowned hospitals, finally giving her the care she deserved.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Corefire</strong>, developed by <strong>Asteroid Games</strong>, isnâ€™t just a battle for survival â€” itâ€™s a story of sacrifice, courage, and the fire that drives us to protect what we love.
